# miracle

## This project has been obsoleted by [Rinze](https://github.com/Damillora/Rinze)

I migrated the website to use Svelte and SASS for multiple reasons,
including much faster build times. miracle is now obsolete and unmaintained.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
