            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <blockquote>
              Overall, I've gotten what I wanted to see in a mobile rhythm game. Virtual Lives are also very interesting with many possibilities that can happen. The other aspects are cherry on top, and they're also not bad too. Project SEKAI is great.
